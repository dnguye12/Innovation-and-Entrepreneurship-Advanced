                            Incorrect waste sorting causes contamination of recyclable materials and increases the

                            Paris has many Michelin restaurants with wide differences in price, location, and style.
                            Users struggle to plan efficient routes and balanced budgets while enjoying diverse culinary
                            experiences.

                        <td>The app records each dining experience and personal taste preference, then uses map-based
                            and budget-planning algorithms to generate the optimal dining route.
                            It ensures monthly or quarterly spending balance while recommending restaurants across
                            different styles — traditional, modern, creative, or fusion French cuisine.

                            In student residences (like where i live) or shared buildings, laundry rooms are often
                            crowded, and users forget their clothes in the machine or arrive while all machines are
                            occupied especially on week ends.
                            There’s no simple way to know which machines are available, when a cycle will end, or to
                            organize a fair waiting queue.

                            cycle is done, and updates the machine’s status in real time. Others can check availability
                            and join a waiting list to be notified when a machine becomes free.
